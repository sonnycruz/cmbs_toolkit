# cmbs_toolkit

## About
This repository consists of a collection of functions that I created over the past year and a half (~Jan 2017 - May 2018) while learning Python and working with CMBS loan data as a commercial real estate analyst. 

Although the functions I created were specifically made for CMBS loan data (.CSV files), the functions are, for the most part, flexible enough that they can be used to work with almost any .CSV or excel file. Python has been a great tool to work with relatively large data files and I hope other business analysts find the functions useful.

## Data
Due to the Terms of Use associated with the CMBS loan data, I am not able to provide the CMBS loan data for the public to download.

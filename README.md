# cmbs_toolkit

#### (A collection of functions I created to assist my everyday workflow.)


## Data
The functions contained herein were created while working with CMBS loan data. The loan data is proprietary and will not be availble in this repo. 

I hope the functions provide examples of how python/pandas can be utilized when working with excel or csv files within in a business/analyst context.
